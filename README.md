## Description
As a python programmer with product management and marketing work experience, I am fascinated by automation tools that facilitate work efficiency and drive better customer experiences.\
In 2024, AI productivity tool is not a dream anymore. Both OpenAI and Google provide LLM models for developers to build AI product.
Thus, the highlight of this app is that I used Google Gemini model to generate AI-wise app review analysis.
Besides, I chose Google Sheet as a database for data pipeline process, and you could also use the output Google Sheet as data source for data visualization with Looker or Tableau.

For example, these are screenshots of the output Google Sheet that provides app reviews analysis from the []().
